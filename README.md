# CMS built with PHP and MySQL

This project is a CMS built with PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS.

# How it works:

### 1. Create the database
Before you can start using it, you have to create the database.
So login into your phpMyAdmin or what else you are using.

Create a database with the name **cms_pages**

#### Create the folowing tables in **cms_pages**:

## pages
**ID** is the PRIMARY KEY, so keep in mind that you tick **AUTO_INCREMENT** and dont't let it be null, so tick **NOT NULL**.
